I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in the [Li](https://thelilab.com/) and [Stephens](https://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/) labs at the Section of Genetic Medicine of the University of Chicago. I develop computational methods to study the genetic and molecular mechanisms that govern RNA splicing from single cells to population-scale genomics. I am particularly interested in how splicing impacts gene expression and its role in human disease.

I earned my Ph.D. in Computational Biology at UC Berkeley advised by Drs. [Liana Lareau](http://www.lareaulab.org/) and [Nir Yosef](https://yoseflab.github.io/). Before that, I got my Bachelor\' Degree in Biology at the [National Autonomous University of Mexico](https://www.fciencias.unam.mx/).
