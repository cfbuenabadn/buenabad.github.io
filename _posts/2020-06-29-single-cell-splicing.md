Previous studies have reported that single-cell alternative splicing is binary: most cells produce either one isoform or the other, but rarely both. We found that the low-capture efficiency of scRNA-seq methods accounts for most of this pattern. In reality, single-cells can produce multiple isoforms from the same gene; we are just missing most of them experimentally.
